Cerebrum DAO has been operating post Token Genesis Event since April 2024. To-date, we have not had a formal Treasury Management system approved by the Cerebrum Community other than our Compensation Plan in CDP-10. Cerebrum holds a material amount of ETH, NEURON, CLAW, and BIO in its treasury, and will be investing in several new IPTs to come in addition to potential new OTC funding as approved in CDP-15.

We believe it is time to propose a Treasury Management system to generate some passive income on assets within our Treasury. We do not want to make this a complicated framework, nor is it our intention to make staking and investing a core function of Cerebrum. However, it is prudent to earn passive income and/or generate ETH to fund more science through staking, liquidity provisioning, and other passive income activities with our Treasury Assets provided that conservative guardrails exist to properly manage risk and preserve the core Treasury to fund science.

To that end, we are proposing the following Treasury Management Guidelines:

1. **Stablecoin Management**
    a. Maintain USDC sufficient to cover a minimum of 6 months of forecasted expenses and investments;
    b. Up to 40% of USDC can be posted to earn passive income in DeFi on protocols such as AAVE.
2. **ETH Prioritization**
    a. Other than the required USDC allocation, the highly liquid Treasury should be maintained in ETH or WETH, which is the native asset of the Ethereum Blockchain ecosystem in which we operate;
    b. 30% to 50% of ETH and WETH should be staked in a yield-bearing asset such as stETH, wstETH, and/or RETH to generate passive income
3. **Other L1 Prioritization**
    a. The same rules shall apply for other Blockchain ecosystems on which we build an ecosystem and community. This can include Solana, Avalanche, or others for example.
4. **Liquidity Provisioning**
    a. Native Tokens such as NEURON and IPTs generated from Cerebrum funded IP-NFT Projects may be leveraged to provide liquidity in LP pools to generate trading fees and where appropriate to provide one-sided liquidity which can generate ETH for funding science;
    b. Additional Tokens earned through partnerships, rewards, or other methods (e.g. BIO) may be applied to provide liquidity in LP pools to generate trading fees and where appropriate to provide one-sided liquidity which can generate ETH for funding science.
5. **Airdrops and Staking Rewards**
    a. The use of Airdrops and Staking mechanisms to reward members of Cerebrum and its various projects shall each require Community Approvals before being deployed and are not covered directly by this Treasury Management Proposal.

By approving CDP-16 you are authorizing Cerebrum to execute the Treasury Management system proposed above within the guidelines stipulated. Any variance from these guidelines must seek community approval via a soft governance vote where appropriate or if not appropriate through a new CDP that overrides or modifies this CDP-16.","['For', 'Against', 'Abstain']",2024-12-29 15:37:08,2025-01-03 15:37:08,closed,0xeEd06591f929895b27752F690e970BcCBe963f66,2024-12-29 13:37:08,"[6639917944.794216, 0, 0]",6639917944.794216,16

We currently have qualified demand for over $3 million in purchases. All OTC buyers have been or first must be cleared through KYC/AML before we will proceed on any transactions.

Cerebrum believes it is in the best interest of the DAO and its NEURON HODLRs to raise this available capital now under the terms proposed below. Our rationale for this is as follows:

- DeSci is on the cusp of a breakout year in 2025, with early momentum building these past couple of months.
- Cerebrum is staffed and its community is engaged to aggressively invest in its mission, including key product initiatives, IP development, and other compelling projects that will leverage the NEURON token and longitudinal streaming health data (e.g. the xponetiq partnership in CDP-12).
- We believe aggressive development of these initiatives and funding new IP-NFT/IPT opportunities will return huge multiples to the DAO over the coming DeSci bull cycle. Now is the time to accelerate.
- We have one approved and funded project that will generate revenues for Cerebrum DAO and another one in the pipeline that we want to fund and develop in early 2025; these OTC funds will help us deliver both projects and thus revenue potential to the DAO; revenues reduce our burn rate, reduce our reliance on external funding for sustainability, and even create the potential for profits which can be used to repurchase NEURON tokens from the open market.
- The more initiatives we can spin up over the next few months, the more this will create outsized momentum for Cerebrum and NEURON, and create a flywheel effect for funding future IP at scale.
- Additional treasury is also wise to save for the next downcycle, especially if it comes faster than expected, so that we can continue to BUIDL (HODL for hard core builders!) through a downmarket.

Cerebrum already has identified several opportunities that would accelerate upon completing this OTC transaction. Some of these are listed below:

- Develop and launch a Data Marketplace protocol. This protocol will address the growth in health and lifestyle related data being generated on a daily basis and the need for decentralized health data to be aggregated while protecting user rights. It will establish a foundation for new developments in health personalization as well as new trial designs and data access for biomarker development.
- The first use case within the Data Marketplace would be a funded pool to allow Cerebrum to provide NEURON as rewards to xponetiq app users who want to stream their data. Upon success, the Data Marketplace would be open to any parties that want to incentivize data collection with tokens in exchange for potential compensation from interested third parties. Data will be completely deidentified and encrypted end to end.
- Invest in promoting the success of NEURON-Percepta and promotion of the Percepta product with NEURON involvement, which can drive revenue operations and potential surplus funds for Cerebrum DAO.
- Fund a minimum of 10 more Translational Neuroscience IP-NFT / IPT and Product projects in 2025.
- Additional proceeds will allow us to evaluate projects that are further derisked and thus require larger initial capital commitments.
- Establish and execute a Solana strategy, which is likely to include launching the Data Marketplace protocol on the Solana Blockchain and bridging NEURON to Solana for the initial data acquisition use case.

Projected allocation of the proceeds would be as follows. These uses would each require NEURON governance at the time of proposal in order to pass. Each initiative will have its own CDP detailing the planned spending of funds. This CDP does not provide authorization to spend the funds:  

- $500K to establish the Data Marketplace protocol
- $1.75M towards 10 more IP-NFT / IPT projects in 2025
- $500k for treasury reserve
- $250K for operations

**With this CDP-15, Cerebrum is seeking authorization on the following points:**

1. To complete up to $3 million in NEURON OTC sales in one or more transactions with one or more qualified buyers
2. To sell up to 6 billion NEURON (6.9% of our Fully Diluted supply of NEURON) with the following terms, where “lockup” means all tokes are locked in a Sablier lockup contract for the entire period of time and then unlock all at once:
    1. Up to $1.25 million at a 5% discount with a 12 month lockup;
    2. Up to $1.25 million at a 10% discount with a 24 month lockup;
    3. Up to $1.25 million at a 15% discount with a 36 month lockup.
3. The aggregate proceeds shall be no more than what is raised with 6 billion NEURON tokens at the discount schedule listed in item 2 above, and Cerebrum DAO is free to operate within the parameters of the various discounts and lockup periods to allocate the NEURON tokens to qualified buyers in exchange for proceeds as outlined above .","['For', 'Against', 'Abstain']",2024-12-19 22:52:09,2024-12-24 22:52:09,closed,0xeEd06591f929895b27752F690e970BcCBe963f66,2024-12-19 20:52:09,"[8085663111.249771, 0, 0]",8085663111.249771,14

## Summary Deal Analysis
*(For the detailed summary of the Fission proposal, please refer to VDP-143 referenced above.)*


Fission Pharma is developing a first-in-class brain-penetrant small molecule analog of P110, a DRP1-FIS1 interaction inhibitor. P110 is a mito-protective peptide originating from Stanford University [1]. The efficacy of P110 in treating neurodegenerative and cardiac disease is supported by 13 years of research, resulting in 20 scientific publications across 11 disease models and collaboration with 15 independent labs globally. P110 has highly generalised anti-degenerative activity, increasing lifespan in mouse models of neurodegeneration (HD [2-5], ALS [5-6], AD [5, 7, 8], PD [1], MS, stroke, and scrapie) and also a model of ischemic heart disease [9]. Dr. Luis Rios identified a P110-binding site to a switch I-adjacent grove (SWAG) on the DRP1 protein and discovered three molecules mimicking  P110 activity in 2023 [10] demonstrating a comparable efficacy of these molecules to P110 in mouse models of sepsis. These inhibitors have a unique property in that they inhibit the downstream pathophysiological consequences of inflammation without inhibiting physiological immune signals. These compounds aim to provide a route to a first in class,  effective, orally available and brain penetrant treatment for chronic inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, without causing immunosuppression, a limiting factor in chronic inflammation treatment. The most tractable go-to-market strategy will be in a rare neurodegenerative disease (such as ALS) with the life cycle strategy of expansion into age-related degenerative indications such as, but not limited to AD and ischemic heart disease. 

## IP Roadmap
The project does not need to secure any background IP from previous research. The plan is to produce novel and defensible IP by the end of the project filing patents for 3 groups of NCEs with each a distinct PKPD and target indication space:
- **First Group:** Brain penetrant DRP1-FIS1 inhibitors, compositions and uses thereof.
- **Second Group:** Orally available and BBB restricted DRP1-FIS1 inhibitors for systemic indications, compositions and uses thereof.
- **Third Group:** Low penetrance DRP1-FIS1 inhibitors for gut and eye restricted delivery, compositions and uses thereof.
## Experimental Plan
Below is the draft plan proposed for this project divided in four phases with go / no go milestones to trigger funding tranches (also shown) for each one of them:
 
![Picture1.png](ipfs://bafkreiait6w4uzjn6iao44pucjlqrehut3bpfhhma7pb4cg3mxnft5alpa)

Hit secondary confirmation and hit-to-lead optimization will be conducted after the IPT round. 

**Phase 1 (IP Building Round): In Silico Screen for DRP1-FIS1 inhibitors**
We are screening the Enamine REAL library (48 billion structures) for potential hits that bind the DRP1-FIS1 protein-protein interaction groove. These hits are filtered for drug-like properties and problematic functional groups are removed with a series of filters (PAINS and Brenk filters). The library design was biassed toward drugs with BBB penetrant compound-like properties.
**Primary Screen (Pharmaron)**
The 1000 virtual hits are selected for chemical synthesis and subsequently screened for mito-protective effects in Hela cells with readouts being cellular toxicity, IC50, mitochondrial ROS, and DRP1 translocation to the mitochondria. 
**Go/No Go Milestones Phase 1:**
1. Assay parameters optimized for screening 1000 compounds with sufficient statistical power (2 months)
2. Primary screen identifies hit compounds <10uM IC50 (3 months)
**IP-NFT minted and IPT funding round launched.**
 
## Future Plans:
**Phase 2 (IPT Pre-Seed): Lead selection and In-vivo efficacy (not included in this proposal)**

**Potency optimization**
Analogs of the top hits are screened to maximize potency using the primary screen assay.

**Secondary Screen**
Hits are screened for mito-protective effects in human neuronal cell-line with readouts being in vitro toxicity, IC50, mitochondrial ROS, and mitochondrial membrane potential. This assay confirms that efficacy seen in the primary screen translates to a neuronal model.

**In vitro DMPK **
Top hits are screened for solubility, membrane permeability, liver metabolism, and hepatotoxicity. Results inform the hit to lead optimization design effort. IP is filed on high performing scaffolds.
    
**In vitro efficacy in ALS, HD, and AD models**
Disease modifying activity will be confirmed for lead candidates. AD, ALS, and HD patient iPSCs show a profound mitochondrial dysfunction due to mitochondrial and proteotoxic stress and this phenotype is corrected by P110 [3].

Figure 4: Human HD IPSCs treated with peptide P110 (Guo 2013). Lead candidates will be tested in HD, AD, and ALS iPSCs to confirm efficacy in correcting mitochondrial structure, MitoROS, and membrane potential (MMP).

**Lead series selection**
The top compounds will be selected with the help of Nick Camp, a veteran medicinal chemist. Compounds are further optimized until a lead compound is selected for IND enabling studies. 

## IP Building Round Budget Breakdown
The total budget requested for this proposal has been revised to $200,000 broken down as follows:

 
![Picture3.png](ipfs://bafkreidii52pz7nxyzavk4a4polnn6hepeh3jjmxsh22332a5q7hdnyl5u)

## Financing and Cerebrum DAO Funding Terms
The Cerebrum DAO Translational Neuroscience Working Group has recommended funding $200,000, consistent with the budget above, to the project to accomplish Milestones 1 and 2 within Phase I. The funding should be transferred in tranches, based on milestone completion.
Upon success, the Fission Pharma company will mint an  Intellectual Property Non-Fungible Token (IP-NFT) and launch an IPT crowdfunding round to support the remainder of the study. This will advance the project from PRL 2 (validated hypothesis in animal studies) to PRL 4 (Initial hits identified, leads are effective in the secondary screen in neurons). Funding will be contingent on the following conditions:

- Successful accomplishment of Milestones 1-2 within Phase I: (IP Building Round): focusing on identifying promising hits.
- Pre-Seed Round (not included in this proposal): If milestones met for Phase 1, we will proceed to raise approximately $500k via the IPT community-funding mechanism. The objective is to progress from initial hits to lead compounds, positioning Fission for a subsequent Seed round. Details will be determined in a future CDP proposal.

As a part of the agreement, Cerebrum will incorporate and manage the Fission Pharma Operating Company (NewCo) which will manage the day-to-day operations. Ownership of the NewCo will be structured as follows:
- Cerebrum DAO: 85% in Preferred Stock
- PI, Dr. Luis Rios: 15%  in Restricted Common Stock
Proforma IPT ownership:
- Cerebrum DAO: 75%
- PI, Dr. Luis Rios: 15%
- Project Manager and Board Members: 5%
- Project Team: 5%

### Summary Deal Analysis
Arctic Therapeutics (AT) is a drug development company, rooted in applied genomics. AT is a close collaborator of the Center for Applied Genomics (CAG), one of the world’s most respected genomic research institutions. AT is raising €12.5M in new equity from investors to advance its drug pipeline of five treatments, specifically its frontrunners, AT-001 and AT-004. 

The asset AT-001 has been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for a registration study for a rare form of familial dementia, transitioning into more common forms – including Alzheimer’s. The candidate has demonstrated positive results in Phase IIa clinical trial for Hereditary Cystatin C Amyloid Angiopathy (HCCAA). AT-004 is being prepared for a Phase IIa study to treat acne vulgaris, with plans to expand into other inflammatory skin diseases – such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. 

AT-001 is of specific interest to the Cerebrum DAO community. This proposal, therefore, is to ask the Cerebrum DAO community, regarded by the AT team for its strong value alignment in neurodegenerative disease research, for its support in bringing the candidate to the clinic.

### Problem
An estimated 55 million patients globally are living with dementia, with an additional 10 million diagnosed with the disease annually. According to the World Health Organisation, dementia is currently the seventh leading cause of death globally, and one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people. In 2019, dementia cost economies globally USD $ 1.3 trillion. Approximately 50% of these costs are attributable to care provided by informal carers (e.g. family members and close friends). Estimated dementia-related costs are expected to reach a staggering €2.8 trillion by 2030. Dementia, including Alzheimer’s, affects millions worldwide, causing cognitive decline and loss of independence. It is a progressive, debilitating condition with no known cure and the number of cases is rapidly increasing due to increasingly ageing populations. Women are disproportionately affected by dementia, both directly and indirectly, experiencing higher disability-adjusted life years and mortality due to dementia, but also providing 70% of care hours for people living with dementia.

Despite these staggering statistics and the personal, social, and economic toll of dementia, current treatments only manage symptoms without addressing the underlying causes or halting disease progression. This critical gap in effective therapies underscores the pressing need for transformative treatments that can potentially modify the course of the disease, improve patients' quality of life, and alleviate the growing burden on healthcare systems and caregivers worldwide.

### Solution
Arctic Therapeutics is developing its frontrunner treatment, AT-001. It is a second generation molecule, generated as a new chemical entity (NCE) via a repurposing approach. AT holds exclusive rights to develop the IP portfolio related to this treatment and in the field of neurodegeneration, as well as patents for other lead candidates in its pipeline. 

AT-001 breaks up clumps of amyloid that have deposited in the brain and vessel walls, and has shown a strong signal in biomarkers capturing reduction in amyloid protein aggregation. So far, the treatment has demonstrated successful Phase IIa clinical trial data with the first patient, diagnosed with Hereditary Cystatin C Amyloid Angiopathy (HCCAA). Evidence from the study showed a transition from progressive amyloid angiopathy with strokes to a marked improvement with signs of reduced Amyloid-Cystatin C depositions in the skin, with no further life threatening strokes. Notably, there were no significant new stroke/cardiovascular events, 50-95% skin deposits reduction was observed, and no disease progression was noted, demonstrating potential for disease prevention.

AT-001 is an oral treatment, which removes challenges faced by other amyloid protein therapies for dementia, including serious side-effects and blood-brain barrier penetration problems. Its unique mechanism of action (MOA) not only removes amyloid plaques, which have aggregated in the brain, but also prevents the formation of toxic oligomers. This is achieved by reducing disulfide bonds, the structural elements that maintain these detrimental protein structures. In vitro data also suggests that the treatment may have a similar effect in preventing tau tangles.

![Picture2.png](ipfs://bafkreibc6y25awuuk7hungh33zp2vzw5gbgqwnhubigc25xosdctgweu2a)

### Opportunity 
Arctic Therapeutics presents a significant opportunity in the €1.4BN Serviceable Addressable Market for familial dementia and Alzheimer's treatments. AT-001 has shown promising results in breaking up Cystatin-C-amyloid deposits, demonstrating efficacy in its first patient with early-onset HCCAA. This positions the company to potentially capture a substantial portion of the €2.1BN Serviceable Obtainable Market, addressing a critical need in dementia treatment.

![Picture4.png](ipfs://bafkreibalo6z7xvnxeoxenhwpmw2odovqdlqj4d26r47tvejburlfa7pty)

### Relevance to Cerebrum DAO 
Cerebrum DAO aims to identify, fund and support the development of promising research and translational projects to accelerate the development of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. 

AT-001 has already been tested in a 24-month Phase I/II study in patients with retinitis pigmentosa associated with Usher syndrome. The highest safe dose was set at 500mg/day. (Clinical efficacy has not been definitively established.) Currently a biomarker clinical study is planned in selected Alzheimer’s Disease patients. At present, only in vitro and animal model in vivo studies support the efficacy of AT-001 in reducing amyloid plaques.

The Blood-Brain Barrier penetration capability of AT-001 allows to hypothesise that the compound may act similarly to disassemble amyloid plaques in the brain. Previous applications and clinical trials have partially de-risked the compound’s profile for patients. Given this data, the Phase III clinical trial of AT-001 is aligned with Cerebrum DAO’s mission to find a potential cure for dementia.

### IP Roadmap 
Arctic Therapeutics holds the exclusive licence for applications of AT-001. 

### Financing and Cerebrum DAO Terms
AT is actively seeking funding to propel their research forward. They recognize the value that Cerebrum DAO and its members bring, both in terms of financial support and expertise. They are offering an opportunity for Cerebrum DAO members to provide €75,000 in funding. AT is raising a minimum of €20M and has also secured non-dilutive funding. AT is expecting the close of the round in mid-October.

The goal of this proposal is to authorize Cerebrum DAO to enter into a Product Partnership with 21 Impact Labs, developer of the xponetiq mobile app. xponetiq is grounded in licensed evidence-based neuroscience and has been designed and developed to support the brain health of individual consumers throughout their lives. The partnership will allow Cerebrum to bring the xponetiq app to the Cerebrum community and establish a knowledge and data sharing strategy between the organizations to further Cerebrum’s goal in addressing brain health and developing neurodegeneration solutions for society.

### 21 Impact Labs
21 Impact Labs (“21 Impact”) is the developer of the xponetiq app for brain health, based on an exclusive license to longitudinal research developed and validated by the University of Texas at Dallas Center for Brain Health, makes exercising brain healthy habits a daily norm for millions, reducing the noise in one’s life, increasing quality time, and achieving peak performance.

### Cerebrum DAO
Cerebrum DAO (“Cerebrum”) is a global network-based organization that is funded and governed by its members via its NEURON token. It seeks to accelerate solutions to brain health and preventions, and cures for brain diseases by deploying its capital and coordinating its global talent to source, fund, develop, and deliver novel evidence-based solutions for human use.

**The rationale for entering into a partnership between Cerebrum and 21 Impact is to:**

(a) bring the xponetiq brain health app to the Cerebrum community, providing longitudinal metrics on brain health assessment, etc; 

(b) expand the use of the NEURON token from governance to a data sharing utility, so that brain health assessment data can be provided by users in exchange for sharing their data;

(c) implement a token staking utility strategy for NEURON such that staking NEURON can be done in exchange for discounts on access to products such as xponetiq;

(d) setup a gateway for consumers to find and participate in the best, evidence-based products and solutions for brain health globally.

Upon approval of this CDP, the Cerebrum will enter into a partnership negotiation phase to bring xponetiq to the Cerebrum community (NEURON holders).

## Considerations
The following are the core considerations for this proposal:

### Partnership Values Alignment
Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), pose significant challenges to our society. These conditions are progressive, leading to loss of neuron function, motor dysfunction, cognitive decline,, and ultimately, a diminished quality of life and death. As our population ages, the prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders is increasing, creating a pressing need for empowering people with primary prevention strategies and accelerating solutions to early diagnosis, treatment, and care. Despite advances in research, a lack of effective therapies remains that can halt, slow down, or reverse disease progression and how interventions can be supported through behavior modification. Cerebrum and 21 Impact are, therefore, seeking a Collaboration Framework to work together and have a positive impact on neurodegenerative disease, combining the strengths of both organizations for the benefit of society.

# Summary Deal Analysis 

This proposal seeks community approval for Cerebrum DAO to enter into a strategic partnership with Cognitive Clarity Inc. The proposed collaboration encompasses three main objectives:

1. Approve $30,000 in funding to replicate in vitro results in studies conducted by Cognitive Clarity. 
2. Secure an upfront funding amount of $100,000 to acquire an ownership interest for Cerebrum of 10% of the IP portfolio of Cognitive Clarity, including all patents and pending patents and results of future research studies on such portfolio. The project IP will be secured in an IP-NFT to enable future fundraising into IP Token sale events to advance the IP to become an approved botanical drug in regulatory regimes such as the US FDA and/or the EU EMA. The $100,000 commitment will only be fulfilled if the replication study in item #1 above is successful.
3. Based on positive outcomes of the replication study results and upon completion of definitive documents for acquiring 10% interest in the Cognitive Clarity IP, Cerebrum will lead an IP Token (“IPT”) auction to raise additional funding for a human observational study of Percepta®, Cognitive Clarity’s natural cognitive enhancement supplement.
4. Upon a successful observational trial with human results, Cerebrum will proceed to integrate Percepta® into Cerebrum's product development roadmap, potentially influencing future innovations in brain health and offering discounted access to the Cerebrum community.

This partnership aims to advance our community’s understanding of mitigating early memory loss, using a safe and commercially available supplement, while providing our community with access to supplements and engagement in research opportunities. Through this partnership with Cognitive Clarity, Cerebrum is positioning itself at the forefront of neuroscience innovation and opening new avenues for growth and scientific exploration.

The community's vote will determine whether we proceed with this collaboration, which has the potential to significantly impact our DAO's future direction and contributions to the field of neuroscience.

Cerebrum DAO (""**Cerebrum**"") is dedicated to advancing neuroscience biotech projects through decentralized collaboration. Cerebrum values the expertise of its members and seeks to provide compelling compensation opportunities for those who bring their talents to achieve our mission. To stimulate community engagement, we propose a transparent, merit-based, and goal-oriented compensation policy using both USDC and Cerebrum's native token, $NEURON. This compensation policy is designed to align contributors with the long-term growth and value creation of Cerebrum while seeking to optimize the supply of USDC in Cerebrum’s Treasury for funding.

Cerebrum aims to align neuroscientists, drug developers, funding contributors, brain health enthusiasts, and those with skills needed for its operational success to accelerate solutions for neurodegenerative diseases and overall brain health. This policy, therefore, aims to reward and incentivize increasing awareness, sourcing and translating high-quality neuroscience projects and developing science-based products and services.

## Compensation Plan

Active and sustained engagement from our community members is essential to successfully pursue our vision and achieve our mission. It is also critical that Cerebrum is committed to the highest scientific standards and adherence to regulatory and reimbursement frameworks in the work we do.

Cerebrum Working Groups (“**WGs**”) aim to unite professionals to perform work across key functional areas of our network, which today include Community & Awareness, Translational Neuroscience, Brain Health Products, and Coordination & Operations. Within each WG structure, several roles exist in Cerebrum that are eligible for compensation, including various Squad leader and role positions.

## Compensation Plan Principles

Cerebrum’s compensation policy is based on three core principles:

#### 1. Transparency:

Critical to the success of any decentralized network organization, we commit to maintain open records of compensation decisions, criteria, and processes.

#### 2. Meritocracy:

We reward contributors based on the quality and impact of their work and seek to promote a culture of excellence.

#### 3. Alignment with Goals:

We incentivize and reward long-term commitment to Cerebrum’s mission and objectives through structured compensation plans, including the $NEURON token.

# 2024-25 Compensation Budget Allocations

Below is the budget we are approving to allocate for the Cerebrum Compensation Plan for the period from 01-September-2024 through 31-December-2025. If more USD(C) or $NEURON is required during this period of time, Cerebrum will need to approve the additional allocation through the Cerebrum DAO governance process, including an accounting of the use of the previously approved consideration and the rationale for the request for additional compensation budget.

- **USDC Compensation Budget**
  - $600,000 USDC Cap
  - Represents 37.5% of the current Cerebrum DAO Treasury held in liquid assets (ETH, WETH, USDC, and USD/CHF)
  - Value of ETH and WETH may go up or down based on the crypto markets
- **$NEURON Governance Compensation Budget**
  - 4.3 billion $NEURON Total
  - 5% of fully-diluted supply
  - 31.5% of existing circulating supply
    - **NEURON Governance Budget**
      - 430,000,000 $NEURON
    - **NEURON QTA Governance Budget**
      - 1,720,000,000 $NEURON
    - **NEURON LTA Governance Budget**
      - 2,150,000,000 $NEURON

While the above request for USDC compensation is a substantial percentage of the existing liquid treasury, it is vital for Cerebrum DAO’s mission to establish a strong foundation with the Core Team and each respective leadership position. It is also vital that each of those contributors is able to dedicate material time on a sustained basis daily and weekly to achieve our goals and objectives. This foundation is expected to drive significant $NEURON value appreciation and facilitate future fundraises to grow the liquid treasury to primarily fund Translational Neuroscience opportunities and Brain Health Product Partnerships. The Brain Health Product WG is focused on Cerebrum’s sustainability, creating revenue-generating opportunities through its partnerships. This will serve to fund the operating budget so that USDC compensation will be funded by ongoing product sales and operations.

The LTA governance budget, while significant, is reasonable for Cerebrum’s early stage of development to incentivize top-tier talent to take on leadership roles in the Core Team, and to align contributors with driving the value of $NEURON on behalf of all stakeholders. In traditional technology startups, a 20% LTA budget is not unreasonable. LTAs vest over 48 months with a 12-month cliff. Contributors who cease to serve Cerebrum in the originally intended capacity are subject to the termination of vesting contracts, allowing reclamation from Cerebrum in order to attract future talent.

This proposal authorizes Cerebrum DAO's Governance Squad to establish a streamlined process that avoids the full governance procedure to swiftly respond to urgent proposals like funding opportunities with a short window of time and necessary amendments to approved proposals. If this proposal is successfully approved, the mechanism outlined here will be added to the previously voted [CDP-1: Cerebrum DAO Governance Framework V1](https://snapshot.org/#/cerebrumdao.eth/proposal/0x6c262a329b6d2e7a6493843b648eb0bc4badc65e1e5cb265ca08877dc68bb317).

## Qualified Soft Governance Proposals

The Soft Governance Mechanism can be utilized by WG Stewards and NEURON hodlers for a fast response to urgent matters for Cerebrum, but must be bound by materiality. Such proposals would be deemed Qualified Soft Governance Proposals and can be submitted for a Soft Governance vote under the terms of this CDP. Below are parameters for what can be considered a Qualified Soft Governance Proposal:

- Funding amounts requiring a short quick response time (e.g. funding a project on Molecule Catalyst) if the amount is $25,000 or less;
- Amendments to prior CDPs provided that the financial impact to Cerebrum is $25,000 or less
- Compensation matters of $25,000 or less so long as they remain bounded by the then-current Cerebrum Compensation Policy.

## Soft Governance Mechanism

Qualified Soft Governance proposals will only be submitted for voting in the [Discord forum](https://discord.com/channels/885561571173085235/1224684727475372052).

To successfully pass, proposals must receive backing from at least two (2) WG leads (Stewards) or Cerebrum Core, along with positive votes from a minimum of six (6) WG members (any) or NEURON Hodlers. Also the proposal must receive more ""Agree"" votes than ""Disagree"" votes.

Only WG members (any) and NEURON Hodlers can participate in commenting and voting. All Cerebrum DAO participants can view proposals.

Proposals must include a poll with the options: “Agree,” “Agree w/ revisions (comments)”, and “Disagree.” The author must address and incorporate feedback from “Agree w/ revisions (comments)” votes. Those who voted “Agree w/ revisions (comments)” should update their choice to “Agree” once their concerns are addressed satisfactorily or to “Disagree” if they have not been addressed.

If a proposal garners fewer than 8 positive votes within the 2-day period, it will be declared void and the discussion will be locked.

Project Transfidelity focuses on preventing neurodegenerative diseases by improving the accuracy of protein synthesis, thereby reducing the formation of harmful protein aggregates. This approach targets the root cause of these diseases, aiming to provide a novel treatment strategy that goes beyond symptom management. 

The proposed research is presented [here at this link.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wuKHLIFbCsZlhCyPPaLDeSsaAveBubPzaV94xlnBguo/edit?usp=sharing)

VitaDAO has done a preliminary assessment of this project as well toward dedicating $50,000 of investment - that assessment and discussion is linked herein. The Problem and Solution sections below are [extracted from the VDP-152 proposal](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-152-funding-project-transfidelity/1702). 

The full CDP-8 Proposal is [available at this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wuKHLIFbCsZlhCyPPaLDeSsaAveBubPzaV94xlnBguo/edit?usp=sharing). 

**This CDP-8 proposal is to authorize Cerebrum investing $50k USD in funding from for the Transfidelity project on the Molecule Catalyst Platform.**

## Project Trans-Fidelity Assessment
Translational fidelity as a mechanistic aspect of aging and disease is an attractive, and still very competitive starting point for drug discovery and development. There are risks and benefits. As drugs would target general mechanisms, they may lack specificity and lead to adverse events and/or lack efficacy. The field is also relatively young and as most companies in the CNS therapeutic area focus on very defined pathophysiology (e.g. amyloids and α-synuclein aggregates in respectively Alzheimer’s Dementia and Parkinson’s Disease) this field may be very attractive to pioneer in.

Some of the data as presented is of high quality but would need due diligence and further discussion with the scientists.

**Pros** 
- Solid science, 
- proof of principle, 
- excellent scientific infrastructure in both universities,
- top scientists involved, 
- this may have much wider implications than just neurodegeneration, and
- strategic value for Cerebrum DAO to begin new collaborations with local Swiss Universities on research related to its mission. 

**Cons**
- the chemistry is very immature, and 
- the approaches need to be very well designed and controlled to create drug-like molecules.

## Senior Reviews
Cerebrum completed three assessments with Senior Reviewers in neuroscience and drug development. Below are links to their assessments, which all are consistent with the conclusions written in this recommendation which support (a) a modest capital commitment at this stage from Cerebrum and (b) support from Cerebrum to ensure the research being conducted under this funding is designed with translation to therapeutic potential in mind from the start.

# Conclusion
It’s a relatively early project that still requires significant work to reach a true proof of concept, in research terms. 

Yet, the field is relatively young and specifically in the field of translational fidelity the competition seems small as compared to other fields, specifically for neurodegenerative diseases. This may be a good time to step in and also assist in some of the crucial decisions to be made.

**Passing CDP-8 will authorize Cerebrum to make a $50,000 investment in Intellectual Property Tokens (IPTs) on the Molecule Catalyst platform, and assign a Deal Squad to have active involvement in collaborating with the Principle Investigators to advance this research toward the clinic.**","['For', 'Against', 'Abstain']",2024-08-08 03:26:52,2024-08-13 03:26:52,closed,0x134abb31987ecc955f236E49ba879A6E31B4D063,2024-08-08 01:26:52,"[11357745144.10608, 0, 0]",11357745144.106081,19

Following the approval of [CDP-4](https://snapshot.org/#/cerebrumdao.eth/proposal/0x3e5f9d206e33e18a47beebc2cacc146898024e513252f2c2f9760e0db862e099), we propose bridging the NEURON token to the [Base](https://www.base.org/) L2 Network to increase adoption. Bridging to Base enables the NEURON token and Cerebrum DAO to take advantage of L2 benefits such as lower transaction fees and access to the Coinbase community. Moreover, we can enable a liquidity trading pool on [Aerodrome Finance](https://aerodrome.finance/), which provides Cerebrum DAO with incentivized rewards at this time.

# Overview

Although the Ethereum Mainnet has its strengths such as a large developer community, an established ecosystem, and broader adoption, the constantly changing and high transaction fees create a barrier for NEURON token transfers and trading activities, and for lower NEURON staking strategies which our Product Working Group is seeking to implement that provide utility to the broad NEURON HODLR community.

L2 networks like Base solve this challenge by offering faster and lower cost transactions. Bridging NEURON from Ethereum Mainnet to the Base L2 Network will enable a more accessible and cost-effective environment for our community by reducing transaction costs for activities that create utility for our community holding the NEURON token. This initiative has the potential to increase the token activity, provide more engagement, and contribute to the growth of our community.

## Liquidity

To create a liquidity trading pool, we plan to use Aerodrome Finance (“Aerodrome”), a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocol that functions as an automated market maker (AMM) and liquidity hub on the Base network. We request 13 ETH and 180,000,000 NEURON tokens for creating a liquidity trading pool on Aerodrome.

By creating a liquidity trading pool on Aerodrome, our community members who add liquidity on Aerodrome will have the potential to earn AERO emissions as rewards. To support this reward initiative, we request up to 90,000,000 NEURON tokens over the next 20 weeks, distributing 4,500,000 NEURON tokens per week/epoch.

# Proposal Terms to Approve

- Authorize the Cerebrum DAO Coordination & Operations Working Group to provide up to 13 ETH and 180,000,000 NEURON tokens for liquidity trading pool creation on Aerodrome Finance as approved under CDP-4.
- Authorize the Cerebrum DAO Coordination & Operations Working Group to spend up to 90,000,000 NEURON tokens over 20 weeks to support liquidity reward initiative on Aerodrome Finance: NEURON/WETH pool.
- Authorize the Cerebrum DAO Coordination & Operations Working Group to either use the AERO emissions earned from liquidity provision as incentives to support reward initiatives or retain them as voting power.","['For', 'Against', 'Abstain']",2024-07-15 11:17:52,2024-07-20 11:17:52,closed,0xeEd06591f929895b27752F690e970BcCBe963f66,2024-07-15 09:17:52,"[5064209879.428995, 257092978.9068381, 0]",5321302858.335834,16

[BoostVC](https://boostvc.com) (“**Boost**”), an early stage venture capital firm with $200m in assets under management based in San Mateo, CA founded by [Adam Draper](https://x.com/AdamDraper) and [Brayton Williams](https://x.com/BraytonKey), would like to acquire NEURONs and become a strategic community member of Cerebrum DAO (“**Cerebrum**”). Boost has a long track record of investing in Crypto and DeepTech, and has been building a compelling DeSci portfolio and network. 

Boost was introduced to Cerebrum during the auction of the NEURON token and only finished discussions and due diligence after the auction was complete. Boost has approached Cerebrum about acquiring a material position of NEURON (i.e. up to $500k in total) which is not practical to do exclusively on the open market due to the early nature of the NEURON trading pools and liquidity depth. 

Furthermore, NEURON is in the early stages of price discovery therefore selling large positions in NEURON may be too dilutive to Cerebrum. 

Cerebrum is in the process of rolling out a [new product working group](https://snapshot.org/#/cerebrumdao.eth/proposal/0xa5a1d19588144a949e54833a249d30e98c248023de72f2d8a9336ec6b8721825) and product strategy to bring further utility to the NEURON token and value to our community. This is a previously unbudgeted initiative which can benefit from having some additional capital to fund working group activity and product partnerships. 

In consideration of these issues listed above and the strategic value and benefit of bringing BoostVC into the Cerebrum community, we are proposing the following compromise offer to BoostVC, which they have accepted. 

1. Cerebrum will sell $250,000 of NEURON OTC to Boost at a 18% discount to the NEURON price on Uniswap with a three-year lockup on all the NEURONs.

2. Boost has agreed to purchase additional NEURON over time to increase their position to their target level. This will include open market purchases on public exchanges (e.g. Uniswap) and may include some private acquisitions. The amounts and timing will be subject to valuation targets and done such that Boost isn’t moving the market against themselves and to help avoid front-runners. 

Overall we believe Boost will achieve a position of $350,000 to $500,000 base in NEURON over time, including $250,000 of direct additional capital to Cerebrum, and contribute to the community as a strategic member.

## Strategic Value to Cerebrum DAO
Boost would be an incredible partner for CerebrumDAO, thanks to their deep experience in both crypto as well as in the hard sciences. They were among the first institutional investors in crypto (via early checks into Coinbase, Etherscan, Unstoppable Domains), and have since expanded to invest in deep tech and specifically bio (including investments into Colossal, InterVenn, Dynomics, GigaMune, and Neurosity). As DeSci emerged over the last several years, Boost has remained on the cutting edge (participating in ResearchHub, Molecule, HairDAO, and Data Lake), bringing with them both a depth of technical knowledge on the crypto side, as well as broad expertise across biotech. We think their strong brand and network will be useful in helping us continue to expand Cerebrum to new audiences of researchers, investors, and also end-users. Finally, after having met the team, we’re excited to know that they’re also deeply aligned with our vision of using web3 tech to solve some of the world's most pressing problems.

## Key Benefits for Cerebrum
1. Strategic value outlined above from Boost’s track record, portfolio and community, including landing on the radar of Silicon Valley and having DeSci more actively promoted in that community;

2. $250,000 of additional capital, which can be leveraged to help fund and launch our upcoming Product Working Group and Cerebrum Community Product initiatives that are expected to increase the utility of the NEURON token;

3. Commitment from a strategic buyer to purchase NEURON in the open market, providing key early price and liquidity support to NEURON as it establishes its token position and trading pools.

# Proposal Terms to Approve
CDP-5, if approved, authorizes Cerebrum DAO to do the following: 

1. Raise $250,000 by selling NEURON to BoostVC at a 18% discount to the  NEURON price on Uniswap;

2. NEURON sold OTC to BoostVC will be locked up for 36 months in a Sablier lockup contract;

The goal of this proposal is to authorize Cerebrum DAO to create a Product Working Group, which will be a new Working Group (WG) added to the DAO in addition to the Coordination WG, Neuroscience Dealflow WG, and Awareness & Community WG.

## Rationale
(a) establish a brain health product strategy, roadmap, infrastructure, and execution framework to bring consumer-focused, evidence-based, products and services to the DAO community that support and enhance brain health; 

(b) create sources of revenue and profit for Cerebrum which will aid the growth and sustainability of the DAO,

(c) implement a token utility strategy for NEURON to benefit NEURON holders with unique benefits and enhance engagement in the DAO;

(d) source, diligence, sign, and leverage external partnerships to quickly bring complementary, evidence-based products and services that fit the overall Brain Health Product Strategy to NEURON token holders; and

(e) provide a framework to design, develop, release, and manage new products and services built exclusively within Cerebrum DAO.

The Cerebrum Product WG will strive to establish Cerebrum as the primary gateway for consumers to find and participate in the best, evidence-based products and solutions for brain health globally. 

Upon approval of this CDP, the Cerebrum Product WG will be tasked with initiating a follow-up proposal including a budget and roadmap for its operations, and begin to deliver products and solutions to NEURON holders.

## Considerations
### Product Design Process
A full Product Design Process involves:
- User research
- Requirements analysis
- Prototyping
- Minimum viable product (MVP) development
- Design phase sign-offs
- Transfer to product releases
- Software deployments
- For physical products, transfer of manufacturing from small scale to serial production batches 
- Constant feedback from users and customers drives efficient engineering and development resource allocation and builds robust products

As the Cerebrum Product WG rolls out its roadmap, strategy, and initial partnerships, which means that an operating budget and development will be required to fulfill its objectives. 

### Partnership Development
While new products may be developed internally within Cerebrum, most products brought to the Cerebrum community will come from partnerships with existing companies that have developed products that fulfill the brain health support needs of the Cerebrum community and are supported with scientific evidence.

Researching and onboarding companies into distribution deals with Cerebrum DAO will accelerate the advancement of the Cerebrum product strategy. These partnerships will also serve to provide unique utility to NEURON token holders. 

The initial execution of the Cerebrum Product WG will be to source compelling, evidence-based consumer products and structure distribution deals for the benefit of NEURON token holders. This effort will require investment in a Cerebrum Brain Health Storefront, certain NEURON staking and reward smart contracts, and an e-commerce interface.

Cerebrum already has several candidate products in our pipeline in the spaces identified in the Market Potential section below. 

### NEURON Utility Design
As the governance token of Cerebrum DAO, NEURON provides governance voting utility to holders. In the Cerebrum product ecosystem, NEURON may take on new utilities including staking, token-gating, rewards and incentives, and participation in research to advance evidence for Cerebrum-sourced products in exchange for providing data and earning NEURONs.

### Market Potential
The potential for consumer-focused brain health products and services is massive and remains largely untapped. Consumers are only recently becoming aware of the potential they have to enhance their brain performance and preserve and protect their brain health. As a result, a growing interest exists in how to extend brain health span to ensure that our bodies do not outlive our brains. 

While this market opportunity has been noticed by many selling false promises, placebo solutions, and worse, people seek scientifically proven solutions and trusted sources. Cerebrum will strive to be that trusted source by curating the best products backed by evidence. Additionally, with NEURON, we can engage token holders to actively participate in improving the evidence behind the best solutions and generating data to identify new ones.

Key opportunities include the following: 
- Digital health solutions that measure brain health and can engage consumers in behavioral change strategies to increase and sustain their brain health
- Wearables to support sleep, meditation, and measuring brain health activity
- Natural product supplements backed by scientific evidence
- Personal at-home digital diagnostics and therapeutics 

The global market for brain health natural products is estimated to be over $20 billion globally by 2030 and is growing at a 13% CAGR. The market for brain health apps is forecasted to be over $16 billion by 2030 and is growing at a 16% CAGR. With big data, AI/ML, AR/VR, and miniaturization/nanotechnology, the market for wearables and personal brain health devices is forecasted to be $1.2 billion globally by 2030 with a 12.3% CAGR. 

## Proposal
Approving CDP-5 will enable the following:
1. Authorize Cerebrum DAO to establish a Product Working Group and initial operations.
2. Enable Cerebrum to begin sourcing brain health products and put forth proposals for launching those to NEURON holders.","['For', 'Against', 'Abstain']",2024-06-04 18:24:42,2024-06-09 18:24:42,closed,0x134abb31987ecc955f236E49ba879A6E31B4D063,2024-06-04 16:24:42,"[8470205467.321434, 0, 0]",8470205467.321434,25

The goal of this proposal is to authorize Cerebrum DAO to create initial liquid trading markets for NEURON on decentralized exchanges (DEX) within the Ethereum ecosystem. 

The rationale for doing so is to: 

(a) broaden access for new parties to acquire NEURONs and become members of the Cerebrum DAO community, 
(b) establish liquid trading markets for NEURON to benefit NEURON holders and the DAO, and 
(c) provide NEURON holders a way to earn fees on their NEURONs if they choose to add to the liquidity of pools. 

## Considerations
The following are the core considerations for this proposal: 

**Amount of liquidity.**
We need the flexibility to provide sufficient liquidity in relation to our circulating market cap - a minimum of 10% of circulating market cap at the time the pool is established is a rule of thumb. This may need to be modified over time to support market cap appreciation. 

**Depth of liquidity and range of support.** 
If we provide full range support we don't have to actively manage or worry about cliffs, however, that can lead to slippage. The opposite is true if we set a range of liquidity. The DAO should consider support for both, but it would need the flexibility to actively manage the range strategy. 

**Support on L2 (e.g. Aerodrome on Base) for lower fees and broader access.** 
While the initial objective is to move quickly, the L2 strategy may take a little longer to arrange due to complexities of bridging and to understand how to maximize incentives on L2 platforms. The DAO will need some liquidity allocation and flexibility to decide on the L2 platform, liquidity amount, and strategy. 

## Proposal
Approving CDP-4 will enable the following: 

1. Authorize Cerebrum DAO to provide up to 100 ETH and 2.3b NEURON for liquidity support in Uniswap v3 Pools on MainNet and potential L2 Pools.

2. Authorize the Cerebrum DAO Coordination Working Group to set and modify liquidity positions and add Uniswap v3 and L2 Pools within the liquidity amounts approved under this proposal (100 ETH and 2.3b NEURON in total ). The Working Group will seek to create and update liquidity positions that provide liquidity depth for NEURON within trading ranges while supporting price discovery. This authorization remains in effect until a future CDP proposal removes or modifies it.

3. The Cerebrum DAO Coordination Working Group shall commit to post a minimum of 70 ETH and 1b NEURON to Uniswap v3 within 3 days of this proposal being approved. 

4. The Cerebrum DAO Coordination Working Group will proactively work with partners such as Bio.xyz to provide additional liquidity support on Uniswap v3 and L2 pools alongside the DAO.","['For', 'Against', 'Abstain']",2024-05-12 21:43:43,2024-05-17 21:43:43,closed,0x134abb31987ecc955f236E49ba879A6E31B4D063,2024-05-12 19:43:43,"[9152643334.524214, 0, 0]",9152643334.524214,36

Following our successful TGE Auction on the Bio.xyz Launchpad, several strong supporters of Cerebrum did not receive participation despite early and even repeat bidding attempts in several cases. 

At auction closing, Cerebrum had 435.07 ETH bid and 327.04 ETH filled, leaving 108 ETH unfilled.

Cerebrum Phase 1 Governance in the Discord Governance Forum passed a proposal (link below) advance the proposal to this Snapshot Governance vote. 

# Proposal
This proposal is to enable participants in the Bio.xyz Launchpad Auction event who had their bids go unfilled with an opportunity to participate with matching bid amounts via an OTC event. Participation is subject to certain conditions and restrictions as the bids were unfilled at prices below the clearing price. 

The benefits of this proposal for Cerebrum are:
- more capital to the DAO to fund research and grow value at modest dilution (approx 1.5% of supply)
- continued early participation from several longer term supporters

We do not think this OTC proposal will diminish the secondary market demand for NEURON. The OTC is available to all unfilled bids, regardless of size. 

## Qualification
Only wallet addresses that were unfilled in the TGE event will be qualified to participate. These are identified in the [Bio.xyz Launchpad Auction results here](https://launchpad.bio.xyz/auctions/557) as ""Refunded"" or ""Outbid"".  

## Key Terms
- Raise up to 108 ETH from TGE auction bidders whose bids failed in the public auction
- OTC participants can only fund up to the amount of their unfilled bids in the TGE auction
- OTC participants will pay the same price per NEURON as all other TGE auction participants
- OTC participants' NEURONs will be locked-up and restricted from transfer for 12 months after which all OTC NEURONs will unlock
- OTC participants must send the required funds to the Cerebrum DAO multisig from the same address they used to bid unsuccessfully in the TGE auction.
- Upon receiving funds from a qualified address, Cerebrum will transfer the appropriate number of OTC NEURONs to a Sablier lockup contract registered to the address within 24 hours.
- DAO will report to the community the outcome of the OTC event and evidence of the Lockups onchain
- The DAO will make best efforts through available channels to communicate this opportunity to all qualified OTC candidates.","['For', 'Against', 'Abstain']",2024-05-03 00:44:05,2024-05-08 00:44:05,closed,0x134abb31987ecc955f236E49ba879A6E31B4D063,2024-05-02 22:44:05,"[11398363435.704348, 30208749.81810201, 0]",11428572185.52245,37

# Relevance to Brain Health
P110 peptide has been shows to improve disease-specific phenotypes in mouse models of ALS, AD, Huntington Disease 

# Simple Summary
(from VDP-143 referenced above) Fission Pharma is creating the first drug-like small molecule P110 mimetics. P110 is a mito-protective peptide originating from Stanford University [1]. The efficacy of P110 in treating neurodegenerative and cardiac disease is supported by 13 years of research, resulting in 20 scientific publications across 11 disease models and collaboration with 15 independent labs globally. P110 has highly generalized anti-degenerative activity, increasing lifespan in mouse models of neurodegeneration (HD [2-5], ALS [5-6], AD [5, 7, 8], PD [1], MS, stroke, and scrapie) and also a model of ischemic heart disease [9]. Dr. Luis Rios published the first small molecule P110 mimetics in 2023 [10] and showed comparable efficacy to P110 in mouse models of ALS and sepsis. These inhibitors have a unique property, they inhibit the downstream pathological consequences of inflammation without inhibiting immune signals. These compounds aim to be the first effective and generalized orally available and brain penetrant treatments for chronic inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, critical hallmarks of aging, and may do so without causing immunosuppression, the limiting factor in chronic inflammation treatment. The most tractable go-to-market strategy will be in a rare neurodegenerative disease (ALS) and they will expand to age-related degenerative indications such as AD and ischemic heart disease, the major limiting factors in human lifespan.

# Funding Milestones
Cerebrum DAO Neuroscience Deal Flow group has recommended the proposal for funding with the following conditions: co-funding the company-building project, initiated and funded with $250,000 from VitaDAO for 60% of the IP-NFT and $83,333 from Cerebrum DAO in exchange for the 20% share of the resulting IP-NFT. 

The funding  should be transferred in tranches, based on the milestones. As the result, the project should move from PRL 2 (validated hypothesis in animal studies) to PRL 4 (Initial hits identified, leads are effective in the secondary screen in neurons).
